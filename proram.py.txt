Software Setup
To start with update your package lists and install a few Python libraries :
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
Then clone the Adafruit library from their repository :
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git
cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
Then install the library for Python 2 and Python 3 :
sudo python setup.py install
sudo python3 setup.py install
1/21/2018 DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and the Raspberry Pi
https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2017/09/dht11-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-raspberry-pi/ 4/6
Hopefully at this point the library is installed and ready to be used within a Python script.
Adafruit Example Python Script
Adafruit provide an example script that you can use to check your sensor is operating correctly.
cd ~
cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
cd examples
Then :
python AdafruitDHT.py 11 17
The example script takes two parameters. The ??rst is the sensor type so is set to “11” to represent the DHT11. The
second is the GPIO number so for my example I am using “17” for GPIO17. You can change this if you are using a
di??erent GPIO pin for your data/out wire.
You should see an output similar to this :
Temp=22.0* Humidity=68.0%
Using the Library In Other Python Scripts
Once the Adafruit library is installed and you’ve got the example script to work you can use the sensor in your own
scripts. Simply import the module, setup a few variables and call the “read_retry” function :
This script can be downloaded directly to your Pi using :
wget https://bitbucket.org/MattHawkinsUK/rpispy-misc/raw/master/python/dht11.py
and run using :
python dht11.py
Buying a DHT11
The DHT11 is available from many electrical component sellers. Here are a selection :

Some may only sell the device itself so you may need to shop around if you would prefer the 3-pin module.

import Adafruit_DHT
# Set sensor type : Options are DHT11,DHT22 or AM2302
sensor=Adafruit_DHT.DHT11
# Set GPIO sensor is connected to
gpio=17
# Use read_retry method. This will retry up to 15 times to
# get a sensor reading (waiting 2 seconds between each retry).
humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, gpio)
# Reading the DHT11 is very sensitive to timings and occasionally
# the Pi might fail to get a valid reading. So check if readings are valid.
if humidity is not None and temperature is not None:
print('Temp={0:0.1f}*C Humidity={1:0.1f}%'.format(temperature, humidity))
else:
print('Failed to get reading. Try again!')
